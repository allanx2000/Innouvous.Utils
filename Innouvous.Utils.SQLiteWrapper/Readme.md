Any project using this needs to target either x64 or x86 and should include the respective folder from this project.

For some reason cannot get it to decide the version and run/compile time (even if the executable project targets x86, it seems it sometimes copies from the x64 folder, even after cleaning it).

Usually x86 is recommended since it is compatible with x64 machines but not the other way around.

The SQLLiteWrapper DLL itself though targets Any Platform
